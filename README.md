# Prediction Measures of Time Series Data
Individual project that was done with various datasets related to time series analysis. The datasets attached are as follows: Dinosaur Park, Sunspots, Electricity Consumption, and Webiste Traffic. 
I was able to do ARIMA modeling for each dataset, but I also found better methods that would work for the specific datasets and explained why that would be better for predictions. 
I hope this information can be potentially helpful for any workers related to some of the subjects such as sunspots, electricity consumption, or website traffic especially.
